The entire point of the app is to see that you are effeciant and not wasting time between tasks, but at the same time not doing to much. A health balance, so there should be a function that which makes 3 versions of a schedule. 1 fast 2 standard and 3 slow. This just increase the time for each task by some % such that the user can adapt to the tempo. 

The app is already working so just try not to messthings up.

Try to leverage localstorage as much as possible and try to make the app more complete.
