# Markdown timer

0. Start from scratch if you need, you replace the index.html with a new one. 

1. Remove the heading for more space, (add a small text somewhere, where it says md-timer), keep the "standard tempo" or similar text at the top.

2. Make the textarea into a proper editor. Have an editmode, have a mode where you cannot select text but rearrange the order of the tasks. Add small buttons within the editor for convenience, perhaps some sec/min/hour solution.

3. Always start tasks with captial letter. If the name of the task is very long come up with a way to handle this, maybe if you press the tasks name it show the entire task name at some point. 

4. "Timer Overview" can be removed and should be included in the editor. Total task time should be included as usual but add target time as well.

5. Put the start button at a better place, it is now at the bottom and is hard to find if you are at the top sometimes. 

6. If you click outside of the timers body (the countdown clock that is rendered when running, with the back, pause skip, stop), you should not cancel the timer, but minimize it. Also see if you can combine those 4 buttons into less buttons.

7. Instead of having the graph as a separate function include it in the actual timer, make it so that you can open it in 1 button press while in the timer view.

8. There should only be one big continious session such that you can get the previous runs. Make sure that the graph displays this session in real time.

9. The score screen should still exist but it is now showing all of the tasks, it is better to just include some stats, efficiency, task complete in time, if the time approxmiated was reached, if you changed pace. At least do not make it so big as it is now, it should be easily pressed away with a click.

10. Make the hambuger menu much bigger or at least easier to press, right now it is weird. Remake the settings page, maybe have the button say "Settings {hambuerger_menu_symbol}", something like that.


11. "Efficiency Analytics" is not that relevant, the imporant thing is that there are graphs that are realtime when you check it out. Right now it does not work at all.

12. Make the vue app mobile first.
